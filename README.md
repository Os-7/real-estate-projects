# Real Estate Projects

This project showcases a list of real estate projects by scraping data based on a city's name and dynamically displaying it on a map using React and Leaflet.

## Setup and Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-projects.git
   cd real-estate-projects
2. **Install dependencies**:
   npm install
2. **Run the development server**:
   npm run dev
Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

# Assumptions and Decisions:
Dynamic Routing: Each city page is dynamically created based on the cityName parameter in the URL.

Real-Time Scraping: Data is scraped from an external API based on the city name.
